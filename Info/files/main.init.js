Within a short time, we decided our town, Santa Rosa, needs to have a placeto play this game. We rounded up local friends we had made through ptanque andbegan the work of getting courts in a park in our town.Getting a city governments buy-in for something new is a test of endurance. We havebeen at this for four years and still are years away from court facilities like in Sonomaor Sacramento. We are getting there slowly; someday, we will be hosting tournamentslike you all do. We did something three years ago that really got us on the radar withthe parks dept. We did a change.org petition that got over 200 signatures and sent theresults to the city council. They saw that and told the Parks department to nd usroom somewhere.So now, we havecontacts in Parkswho are committedto ptanque in SantaRosa. We arecurrently in theprocess of approving3 courts in a smallpark near our house.It will be a placewhere we can showthe game to others.It is a rst step toour ultimate goal ofa full size terrain in alarger park.We started Ptanque La Rose last year with 8 prime members, some from other clubs,some new to the game. This year we have 14, with hopes of signing up more. Weformed the club to give our voice as ptanque players more weight and recruit morepeople. Even though we dont have courts, we nd places to play and share our game.We play in baseball inelds, driveways, parking lots, and the gravel roads in our ruralcemetery. Santa Rosa is known for its roses; we have a Rose Parade, the rose is part ofthe city logo; our logo will also have a rose.
